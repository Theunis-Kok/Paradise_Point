This was a group project in CMPG 213/223

Our group decided to create a system for a holiday location

The functionality included the managing bookings (Insert,Update,Delete,View), managing customers (Insert,Update,Delete,View), managing rooms (Insert,Update,Delete,View), managing activities (Insert,Update,Delete,View), managing jobs (Insert,Update,Delete,View), and managing employees (Insert,Update,Delete,View).

We used C# as it allowed us to make window form applications which meant it was easy to deploy on a desk computer.
We also used a centralized SQL database as it was specified in the rubric
